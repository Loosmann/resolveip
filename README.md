# resolveip

```resolveip``` finds IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6 by default) in texts and resolves them using the system's local resolver.
It is primarily meant as an interactive tool but can also read from files and pipes.

# ToDo

* better documentation
* add more commandline switches for output customization:
    * different ANSI codes for text, results, matches and non-matches
    * remove resolved ip addresses
    * â€¦

These are unlikely to get fixed in the near future as the author is quite happy with the current state and also quite lazy.
